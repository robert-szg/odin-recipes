# odin-recipes
A TOP project

This project is about creating a recipe using only html concepts I've learned

Concepts such as basic tags (paragraph and headline), ordered and unordered lists, links and images, as well as special attributes like href, src, height, width, alt and much more. I can't forget about commits too.
