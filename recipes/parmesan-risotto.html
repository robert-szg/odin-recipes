        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Risotto is a creamy Italian rice dish. In this version, the rice is briefly sauteed, then slowly</p>
        <p>cooked in wine and seasonings. Watch for that magic moment when the risotto transforms </p>
        <p>from just rice in liquid to creamy, tender deliciousness. â€”Taste of Home Test Kitchen</p>

            <li>8 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>3 cups arborio rice</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup dry white wine or water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a saucepan, heat broth and keep warm. In a Dutch oven, saute onion in oil until tender. 
                Add rice and garlic; cook and stir for 2-3 minutes. Reduce heat; stir in wine.
                Cook and stir until all liquid is absorbed.
            </li>

            <p></p>     <!--Simulating a new line-->
            
            <li>
                Add heated broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to absorb between additions. 
                Cook just until risotto is creamy and rice is almost tender, about 20 minutes. 
                Add remaining ingredients; cook and stir until heated through. Serve immediately.
